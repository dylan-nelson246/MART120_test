        <p>Once upon a time there were three little piggies</p>

        <p>Two of these pigs weren''t very smart, but their eldest brother actually had intelligence</p>

        <p>One day, a hungry wolf came along looking to snack on the three piggies</p>

        <p>To save their hides, each of the pigs built a house to defend themselves against the wolf</p>

        <p>Unfortunately, the two not smart pigs built structurally unsound houses, which fell quite easily, and got them eaten</p>

        <p>However, still alive, the eldest pig actually built a house out of brick, proving why he was the only intelligent one</p>

        <p>Unfortunately for the wolf, the house was too strong to knock down, so he couldn't eat the pig</p>

        <p>Stupidly, the wolf thought it best to sneak through the chimney, where he would fall into a boiling pot of water and die</p>

        <p>After the wolf died, the eldest pig lived happily ever after, despite the fact that both of his brothers were dead, but oh well.</p>

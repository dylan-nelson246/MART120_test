In regards to learning styles, I definitely think they have a strong impact on how every individual person is able to learn. Take me for example, I mainly thrive on visual and hands on learning, with the idea that I can actually look at, or tackle my assignment hands on, helps me to visualize how to tackle it. However, the auditory aspect falls flat on me, because I have a hard time remembering spoken information, so In my opinion, and experience, I do think learning styles affect the way people are able to tackle their learning.

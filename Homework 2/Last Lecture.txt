While watching the Last Lecture video, I noticed, that despite his current situation, with all of his medical (issues, we'll say), he still remains chipper, and excitable, and seems to stay positive, despite being dealt a bad hand with his health. When looking through his old pictures, it seems he was about the same mentality as he was currently. Still chipper, still happy, and still holding on to dreams and wishes. What stood out to me the most about the whole video, were his steps towards achieving his childhood dreams. It seems that in regards to all of his childhood dreams, he was determined to achieve all of his dreams. And what stuck out to me, is that he would do whatever it took in order to achieve these dreams. That, to me, was really inspirational, because I feel like I've given up completely on my dreams, just accepting that I probably wont be able to do what I thought I could as a kid, but he didn't, and that's really cool.
